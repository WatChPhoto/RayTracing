# RayTracing

To do list:
* Optimize The ABBA for the cone. Can find the smallest sphere enclosing the cone to get a relatively smaller ABBA.
* Implement the method described in this paper(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016003207000270) to find the smallest circle enclosing the triangle of the cone then use a sphere of the same radius.
* Port cone.h from TheNextWeek to TheRestOfyourLife.
